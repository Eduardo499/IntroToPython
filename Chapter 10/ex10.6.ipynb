    "(Calculating Vector Lengths) A vector is an object that has a magnitude and a direction. A vector is represented as a line segment with an arrow where the arrow represents the direction and the length of the vector is the magnitude. A vector can also be a single point with x- and y-coordinates. The magnitude calculated from this type of vector equals the distance between the origin of the cartesian coordinate system and the point. Write a class Point that represents an (x-y) coordinate pair and provides x and y read-write properties as well as a method to calculate the distance between the point and the origin of the coordinate system. Include __init__ and __repr__ methods. Write a class Vector that has two Point objects as its attributes. Include __init__ and __repr__ methods and a method that can calculate the magnitude of the vector. Test your Point and your Vector class."
