    "(Player Class) Write a class called Player that can be used in a turn-based strategy game to create player objects. Create the following data attributes-the name (a string), level (an int), strength (an int), and Health Points (a Decimal). The class should have an __init__ method to initialize the data attributes. Provide a property for each data attribute. Use validation in the properties of the level and health attribute to ensure that they remain non-negative. Provide a defence method to defend from an attack. The intensity of the attack is calculated as follows—divide the strength of the attacker by a random number between 1 and 3, subtract from this result the strength of our player multiplied with the level of our player. If the intensity is ≤ 0, the player loses, and the intensity is subtracted from the health points of the player."
