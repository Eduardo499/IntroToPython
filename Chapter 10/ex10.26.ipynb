    "(Software Engineering with Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods) When we think of a class, we assume that programs use it to create objects. Sometimes, it’s useful to declare classes for which you never instantiate objects, because in some way they are incomplete. As you’ll see, such classes can help you engineer effective inheritance hierarchies.\n",
    "    Concrete Classes—Consider Section 10.7’s Shape hierarchy. If Circle, Square and Triangle objects all have draw methods, its reasonable to expect that calling draw on a Circle will display a Circle, calling draw on a Square will display a Square and calling draw on a Triangle will display a Triangle. Objects of each class know all the details of the specific shapes to draw. Classes that provide (or inherit) implementations of every method they define and that can be used to create objects are called concrete classes.\n",
    "    Abstract Classes—Now, let’s consider class TwoDimensionalShape in the Shape hierarchy’s second level. If we were to create a TwoDimensionalShape object and call its draw method, class TwoDimensionalShape knows that all two-dimensional shapes are drawable, but it does not know what specific two-dimensional shape to draw—there are many! So it does not make sense for TwoDimensionalShape to fully implement a draw method. A method that is defined in a given class, but for which you cannot provide an implementation is called an abstract method. Any class with an abstract method has a “hole”—the incomplete method implementation—and is called an abstract class. TypeErrors occur\n",
    "when you try to create objects of abstract classes. In the Shape hierarchy, classes Shape, TwoDimensionalShape and ThreeDimensionalShape all are abstract classes. They all know  that shapes should be drawable, but do not know what specific shape to draw. Abstract base classes are too general to create real objects.\n",
    "    Inheriting a Common Design—An abstract class’s purpose is to provide a base class from which subclasses can inherit a common design, such as a specific set of attributes and methods. So, such classes often are called abstract base classes. In the Shape hierarchy, subclasses inherit from the abstract base class Shape the notion of what it means to be a Shape—that is, common properties, such as location and color, and common behaviors,\n",
    "such as draw, move and resize.\n",
    "    Polymorphic Employee Payroll System—Now, let’s develop an Employee class hierarchy that begins with an abstract class, then use polymorphism to perform payroll calculations for objects of two concrete subclasses. Consider the following problem statement:\n",
    "    A company pays its employees weekly. The employees are of two types. Salaried\n",
    "    employees are paid a fixed weekly salary regardless of the number of hours worked.\n",
    "    Hourly employees are paid by the hour and receive overtime pay (1.5 times their\n",
    "    hourly salary rate) for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours. The company wants\n",
    "    to implement an app that performs its payroll calculations polymorphically.\n",
    "    Employee Hierarchy Class Diagram—The following diagram shows the Employee hierarchy. Abstract class Employee represents the general concept of an employee. Subclasses SalariedEmployee and HourlyEmployee inherit from Employee. Employee is italicized by convention to indicate that it’s an abstract class. Concrete class names are not italicized:\n",
    "Employee\n",
    "SalariedEmployee\n",
    "HourlyEmployee\n",
    "    Abstract Base Class Employee—The Python Standard Library’s abc (abstract base class) module helps you define abstract classes by inheriting from the module’s ABC class. Your abstract base class Employee class should declare the methods and properties that all employees should have. Each employee, regardless of the way his or her earnings are calculated, has a first name, a last name and a Social Security number. Also, every employee should have an earnings method, but the specific calculation depends on the employee’s type, so you’ll make earnings an abstract method that the subclasses must override. Your Employee class should contain:\n",
    "    •An __init__ method that initializes the first name, last name and Social Security number data attributes.\n",
    "    •Read-only properties for the first name, last name and Social Security number data attributes.\n",
    "    •An abstract method earnings preceded by the abc module’s @abstractmethod decorator. Concrete subclasses must implement this method. The Python documentation says you should raise a NotImplementedError in abstract methods.26\n",
    "    •A __repr__ method that returns a string containing the first name, last name and Social Security number of the employee. Concrete Subclass SalariedEmployee—This Employee subclass should override earnings to return a SalariedEmployee’s weekly salary. The class also should include:\n",
    "    •An __init__ method that initializes the first name, last name, Social Security number and weekly salary data attributes. The first three of these should be initialized by calling base class Employee’s __init__ method.\n",
    "    •A read-write weekly_salary property in which the setter ensures that the prop- erty is always non-negative.\n",
    "    •A __repr__ method that returns a string starting with 'SalariedEmployee:' and followed by all the information about a SalariedEmployee. This overridden method should call Employee’s version.\n",
    "    Concrete Subclass HourlyEmployee—This Employee subclass should override earn- ings to return an HourlyEmployee’s earnings, based on the hours worked and wage per hour. The class also should include:\n",
    "    •An __init__ method to initialize the first name, last name, Social Security number, hours and wages data attributes. The first name, last name and Social Security number should be initialized by calling base class Employee’s __init__ method.\n",
    "    •Read-write hours and wages properties in which the setters ensure that the hours are in range (0–168) and wage per hour is always non-negative.\n",
    "    •A __repr__ method that returns a string starting with 'HourlyEmployee:' and followed by all the information about a HourlyEmployee. This overridden method should call Employee’s version.\n",
    "        Testing Your Classes—In an IPython session, test your hierarchy:\n",
    "    •Import the classes Employee, SalariedEmployee and HourlyEmployee.\n",
    "    •Attempt to create an Employee object to see the TypeError that occurs and prove that you cannot create an object of an abstract class.\n",
    "    •Assign objects of the concrete classes SalariedEmployee and HourlyEmployee to variables, then display each employee’s string representation and earnings.\n",
    "    •Place the objects into a list, then iterate through the list and polymorphically pro- cess each object, displaying its string representation and earnings."
