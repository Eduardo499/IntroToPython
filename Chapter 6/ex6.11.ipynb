    "(Analyzing the Game of Craps) Modify the script of Fig. 4.2 to play 1,000,000 games of craps. Use a wins dictionary to keep track of the number of games won for a particular number of rolls. Similarly, use a losses dictionary to keep track of the number of games lost for a particular number of rolls. As the simulation proceeds, keep updating the dictionaries.\n",
