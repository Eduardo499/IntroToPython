    "(Project: Cooking with Healthier Ingredients) In the “Dictionaries and Sets” chapter’s exercises, you created a dictionary that mapped ingredients to lists of their possible substitutions. Use that dictionary in a script that helps users choose healthier ingredients when cooking. The script should read a recipe from the user and suggest healthier replacements for some of the ingredients. For simplicity, your script should assume the recipe has no abbreviations for measures such as teaspoons, cups, and tablespoons, and uses numerical digits for quantities (e.g., 1 egg, 2 cups) rather than spelling them out (one egg, two cups). Your program should display a warning such as, “Always consult your healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet.” Your program should take into consideration that replacements are not always one-for-one. For example, each whole egg in a recipe can be replaced with two egg whites."
