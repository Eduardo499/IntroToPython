    "(Check Protection) Although electronic deposit has become extremely popular, payroll and accounts payable applications often print checks. A serious problem is the intentional alteration of a check amount by someone who plans to cash a check fraudulently. To prevent a dollar amount from being altered, some computerized check-writing systems employ a technique called check protection. Checks designed for printing by computer typically contain a fixed number of spaces for the printed amount. Suppose a paycheck contains eight blank spaces in which the computer is supposed to print the amount of a weekly paycheck. If the amount is large, then all eight of the spaces will be filled:\n",
    "    1,230.60 (check amount)\n",
    "    --------\n",
    "    01234567 (position numbers)\n",
    "On the other hand, if the amount is smaller, then several of the spaces would ordinarily be left blank. For example,\n",
    "      399.87\n",
    "    --------\n",
    "    01234567\n",
    "contains two blank spaces. If a check is printed with blank spaces, itâ€™s easier for someone to alter the amount. Check-writing systems often insert leading asterisks to prevent alteration and protect the amount as follows:\n",
    "    **399.87\n",
    "    --------\n",
    "    01234567\n",
    "Write a script that inputs a dollar amount, then prints the amount in check-protected format in a field of 10 characters with leading asterisks if necessary. [Hint: In a format string that explicitly specifies alignment with <, ^ or >, you can precede the alignment specifier with the fill character of your choice.]"
